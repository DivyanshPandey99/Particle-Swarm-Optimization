# Particle Swarm Optimization Simulation

This project is a simulation of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, used to find the location of food. It is built using the Pygame library and involves particles with velocity, x and y positions.

## Installation

To run the simulation, you will need to install the Pygame library. You can do this using pip:

```
pip install pygame random
```
